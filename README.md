# Image Processing Project

## Overview
Image Processing involves performing operations on an image to enhance it or extract useful information. This repository provides a robust framework for performing various image processing tasks, leveraging the power of OpenCV and other popular libraries. The project is designed for researchers, engineers, and enthusiasts looking for efficient and flexible solutions for their image processing needs.

## Features
- **Basic Operations**: Perform tasks such as resizing, cropping, and rotating images.
- **Filtering Techniques**: Apply filters like Gaussian Blur, Median Filtering, and Bilateral Filtering.
- **Edge Detection**: Use methods like Canny Edge Detection and Sobel Operators.
- **Morphological Operations**: Includes dilation, erosion, opening, and closing.
- **Histogram Analysis**: Calculate and visualize image histograms for intensity distribution.
- **Object Detection**: Integrate pre-trained models for object detection tasks.
- **Cross-platform**: Compatible with Linux, Windows, and macOS.

## Installation
